# Vulnerability Remediation: Foxit PDF - CVE-2024-9254

## Overview
A **use-after-free vulnerability** (CVE-2024-9254) was identified in **Foxit PDF Reader and Editor**, rated **High severity (CVSS 8.8)**.  
The application was no longer actively used in the environment and existed only as a **remnant installation** on a subset of endpoints.

- **First Detected:** ~July 2025  
- **Last Detection:** ~August 2025  
- **Status:** Resolved (software removed)  

## Risk
- **Category:** Application Exploit  
- **Impact:** Potential remote code execution from malicious PDF files.  

## Remediation Strategy
Rather than upgrading Foxit to a patched version, the decision was made to **retire the application**:
- The organization already had **other supported PDF solutions** in place.  
- Removing Foxit eliminated the vulnerable software entirely, reducing attack surface.  
- This approach also avoided the need for ongoing patching and maintenance of an unused application.  

### Actions Taken
1. **Discovery**  
   - Vulnerability flagged through enterprise vulnerability scans.  
   - Confirmed Foxit was not part of the approved application stack.  

2. **Decision**  
   - Verified that existing PDF tools fully bridged functionality needs.  
   - Determined that upgrade efforts were unnecessary.  

3. **Remediation**  
   - Targeted Foxit installations identified across endpoints.  
   - Deployed **Intune remediation policy** to uninstall all versions of Foxit.  
   - Monitored vulnerability platform to validate findings closure.  

## Intune removal
To ensure full removal, I
- Queried tenant-wide discovered applications using a **Graph API PowerShell utility** ([example script](https://github.com/anguzz/powershell/blob/main/Graph/getDiscoveredApps/findDiscoveredAppsList.ps1)).  
- Collected all endpoints with Foxit installations into a targeted Intune group.  
- Packaged and deployed an **Intune remediation script** to uninstall Foxit PDF Reader/Editor across all detected versions.  
- Validated through reporting and vulnerability scans that all instances were successfully removed.  


## Outcome
- **CVE-2024-9254 mitigated** by removing all Foxit installations.  
- Reduced long-term maintenance by consolidating to fewer PDF tools.  
- Closed out vulnerability with zero impact to user workflows.
